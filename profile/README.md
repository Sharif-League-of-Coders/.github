The "Sharif League of Coders" (LoC) is an enlightening coding competition organized by the students of the Computer Engineering department at Sharif University. This event is specifically designed for computer science freshmen at Sharif University and aims to foster a deepened interest in various computer science fields, including hardware, blockchain, and machine learning, among participants. By presenting challenging coding problems, the LoC encourages learning and interaction within a community of programmers nationwide, focusing on second-semester students of the same department.

Requiring only basic programming skills to participate, the LoC ensures that additional support is available from the organizers if needed. Students can stay informed and participate by following updates on the [event's Telegram channel](https://t.me/LOCSharif).

This competition not only serves as a platform for academic growth but also as a means to cultivate a passion for computer science among students through practical engagement and collaborative learning.
